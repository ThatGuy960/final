      <h2> About Me</h2> 
      
      <p> KMF is short for Keep Moving Forward. It was originally the name for my independent record label, however I wanted the name to be much more than that. Now it has grown to be the name of everything related to my digital footprint. </p>

      <h3>Creative Endeavors.</h3>

      <p> I have been producing, creating and making music for 5 years. I have released countless official projects and even more independent projects to my name. This is the place to experience all of my creative endeavor from my youtube videos, to my instagram photography. 
</p>

    <p>
      The only social media accounts I have are the ones I have listed.
